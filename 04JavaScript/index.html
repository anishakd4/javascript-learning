<!--
Box model defines how elements are displayed on a webpage and also how they are sized.

So according to the box model, each and every element on a webpage can be seen as a rectangular box and each box can have a width,
a height, padding, margins and a border.

And we can specify all these using CSS properties, but note that they are all optional. So there can be boxes with no margins
or no paddings or no border at all.

first the content of a box is where all the text images and other content that we specify goes.

We can easily define its height and with using the corresponding CSS properties.

Next, the padding is a transparent area around the content but still inside of the box.
